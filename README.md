## Description

This project is all about pushing the limits of **HTML and CSS** to create engaging and interactive web elements **without relying on JavaScript**. By exploring various CSS techniques such as **sprites, animations, transitions, and custom toggles**, this project aims to enhance creative front-end development skills.

Each task presents a unique design challenge, requiring the use of **pure CSS solutions** to replicate specific visual effects. From sprite-based icons to animated underlines, interactive toggles, and creative navigation menus, this project demonstrates the power and flexibility of CSS.

## Project Structure

The `holbertonschool-Fun-with-CSS` directory includes the following files:

| File           | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-styles.css` | Implements a **sprite-based** icon system for different programming languages. Uses a single image (`0-sprite.png`) and CSS to position the icons within the list items. |
| `1-styles.css` | Creates an **animated underline effect** for a hyperlink, where the underline appears slowly when hovered.                                                               |
| `2-styles.css` | Styles a **custom toggle switch**, replacing the default checkbox appearance with an interactive switch design.                                                          |
| `3-styles.css` | Implements a **hamburger menu animation**, where clicking the menu button expands and reveals different chart icons.                                                     |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, the following concepts should be mastered:

- Implement **sprite-based** icons using CSS background positioning.
- Use **CSS transitions** to create smooth visual effects.
- Design **custom UI components** such as toggles and menus purely with HTML and CSS.
- Apply **CSS animations** to enhance interactivity and user experience.
- Develop an understanding of **checkbox hacks** for interactive elements without JavaScript.

Mastering these CSS techniques enables the creation of highly interactive web elements, pushing the boundaries of what is possible using **pure HTML and CSS**.
